ðŸ•µ# Fraud Detection System

# Description

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. It analyzes transaction data to identify patterns that distinguish legitimate activities from potential fraud. The model is trained on historical data, extracts meaningful features, and predicts the likelihood of fraud in new transactions.

# Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visual insights

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Fraud probability prediction for new transactions

Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

# Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

VS Code / Google Colab


# How It Works

Load and clean the dataset.

Explore and visualize transaction patterns.

Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost , SVM).

Evaluate model performance using various metrics.

Predict fraud in unseen transactions.
